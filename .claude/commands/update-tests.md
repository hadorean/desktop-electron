# ðŸ§ª Updating tests

The specifications have been updated, update the tests to match the new specifications.

- Compare existing tests name with the new spec list.
- Add new tests for new specs.
- Remove tests for removed specs.
- Some specs may have been just reformulated, make sure to update the test names accordingly.
- Make sure the path to the spec file in the test file is correct.

Make sure to have the correct specification file before starting.
If I didn't gave you the test file or the spec file, ask me for it.
