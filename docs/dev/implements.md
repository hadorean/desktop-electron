# ðŸ’¡ Implements

This plan detail the implementation of a feature we want to implement.
Make sure you understand the context first. Analyze the codebase if needed, read the readme.md first to understand the overall structure.
Commit regularly (each phase).
When you are done with a functionality, use 'pnpm typecheck', 'pnpm format' and 'pnpm lint' to detect and address issues.
Use 'pnpm dev' if you need to run the app.
