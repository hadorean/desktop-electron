# Overview

This section contains development notes, memories, and project milestones.

This notes are used to resume a conversation with Claude and give it context about what we have been working on:

- what we try to achieve
- what we have done
- mistakes we made
- what we have learned
- etc.

It is automatically populated with all markdown files in the memories folder.

Use the [`/memorize`](../claude/commands/memorize.md) command with Claude Code to create a new memory file.
