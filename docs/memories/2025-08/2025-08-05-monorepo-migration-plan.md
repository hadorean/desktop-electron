# Monorepo Migration Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Preparation and Analysis üîç ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1.1 Analyze Current Dependencies
- [x] Document all dependencies in `app/package.json`
- [x] Document all dependencies in `client/package.json`
- [x] Identify shared dependencies that can be hoisted
- [x] Identify conflicting dependency versions
- [x] Document current build scripts and their interdependencies

### 1.2 Backup Current State
- [x] Create a git branch for the migration: `feature/monorepo-migration`
- [x] Ensure current setup works and tests pass
- [x] Document current npm scripts and build commands
- [x] Note any Electron-specific build configurations

### 1.3 Plan New Structure
- [x] Design target monorepo directory structure
- [x] Plan package naming conventions
- [x] Identify which tools/configs need to move where
- [x] Plan workspace dependencies and relationships

## Phase 2: Create Shared Package üì¶ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 2.1 Create Shared Package Structure
- [x] Create `pkg/shared/` directory
- [x] Set up `pkg/shared/package.json`
- [x] Configure `pkg/shared/tsconfig.json`
- [x] Set up build configuration for shared package
- [x] Create `pkg/shared/src/` with proper structure

### 2.2 Extract Shared Types
- [x] Identify shared types from both projects
- [x] Create type definitions in `pkg/shared/src/types/`
- [x] Set up proper exports in shared package
- [x] Create index files for clean imports

### 2.3 Extract Shared Utilities
- [x] Move validation utilities to shared package
- [x] Move helper functions to shared package
- [x] Move constants and enums to shared package
- [x] Set up proper module exports

## Phase 3: Restructure Project Layout üèóÔ∏è

### 3.1 Create Packages Directory Structure
- [x] Create `pkg/` directory
- [ ] Move `app/` to `pkg/app/`
- [ ] Move `client/` to `pkg/client/`
- [ ] Update all relative paths in moved directories
- [ ] Update import statements to use new paths

### 3.2 Set Up Root Package.json
- [ ] Create/update root `package.json` with workspaces configuration
- [ ] Move shared devDependencies to root level
- [ ] Configure workspace scripts for common commands
- [ ] Set up consistent script naming across packages

### 3.3 Configure Workspace Dependencies
- [ ] Add shared package as dependency to app
- [ ] Add shared package as dependency to client
- [ ] Remove duplicate dependencies between packages
- [ ] Test that workspace linking works correctly

## Phase 4: Update Build Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### 4.1 Update Electron App Configuration
- [ ] Update `electron.vite.config.ts` for new structure
- [ ] Update TypeScript configurations
- [ ] Update build scripts to work with monorepo
- [ ] Ensure Electron packaging still works
- [ ] Test hot reloading with shared packages

### 4.2 Update Client Configuration
- [ ] Update Vite configuration for new structure
- [ ] Update TypeScript configurations
- [ ] Update build scripts and paths
- [ ] Test that client build works correctly
- [ ] Ensure hot reloading works with shared code

### 4.3 Update Root Level Scripts
- [ ] Create root-level dev script to run both apps
- [ ] Create root-level build script for all packages
- [ ] Create root-level test script
- [ ] Update existing scripts in README and package.json

## Phase 5: Migrate Code to Shared Package üîÑ

### 5.1 Move Types and Interfaces
- [ ] Move settings types to shared package
- [ ] Move API types to shared package
- [ ] Move socket event types to shared package
- [ ] Update imports in both packages
- [ ] Test type checking works correctly

### 5.2 Move Utility Functions
- [ ] Move validation functions to shared package
- [ ] Move helper utilities to shared package
- [ ] Move formatting functions to shared package
- [ ] Update imports and test functionality

### 5.3 Move Constants and Configuration
- [ ] Move API endpoints to shared package
- [ ] Move default settings to shared package
- [ ] Move socket event names to shared package
- [ ] Update imports and verify behavior

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation ‚úÖ

### 6.1 Development Workflow Testing
- [ ] Test `npm run dev` works for both packages
- [ ] Test hot reloading works with shared code changes
- [ ] Test TypeScript intellisense works across packages
- [ ] Test build process completes successfully

### 6.2 Electron-Specific Testing
- [ ] Test Electron app launches correctly
- [ ] Test Electron packaging/building works
- [ ] Test background windows work with shared code
- [ ] Test socket communication works correctly

### 6.3 Client-Specific Testing
- [ ] Test client app runs in development
- [ ] Test client build process works
- [ ] Test client can connect to Electron server
- [ ] Test all shared functionality works

## Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup üìö

### 7.1 Update Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new structure
- [ ] Update development setup instructions
- [ ] Document new npm scripts and commands
- [ ] Update project structure documentation

### 7.2 Clean Up and Optimize
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Clean up old configuration files
- [ ] Optimize workspace dependency tree
- [ ] Run final tests and quality checks

### 7.3 Migration Completion
- [ ] Create pull request with changes
- [ ] Document any breaking changes
- [ ] Update CI/CD if applicable
- [ ] Merge migration branch

## Known Risks and Mitigation Strategies ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Electron Build Issues
- **Risk**: Electron packaging might break with monorepo structure
- **Mitigation**: Test packaging early, keep Electron configs isolated

### Hot Reloading Problems
- **Risk**: Shared package changes might not trigger reloads
- **Mitigation**: Configure file watchers properly, test extensively

### Dependency Conflicts
- **Risk**: Version conflicts between packages
- **Mitigation**: Use yarn resolutions or npm overrides if needed

### Path Resolution Issues
- **Risk**: Module resolution might break with new structure
- **Mitigation**: Update tsconfig.json paths, test imports thoroughly

## Success Metrics üìä

- [ ] All existing functionality works unchanged
- [ ] Development workflow is same or faster
- [ ] Code duplication is eliminated
- [ ] Type safety is maintained/improved
- [ ] Build times are same or better
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
