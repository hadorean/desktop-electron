# Summary of the day

Date: 2025-08-15

## Overview

Completed comprehensive refinements to the settings UI components, addressing visual consistency issues and fixing functionality bugs identified during testing.

## Changes Made

### Screen Selection Interface
- Converted tab-based screen switcher to icon-driven interface per specifications
- Added animated underlines with screen-specific colors and smooth transitions
- Implemented proper screen type identification (static/interactive)
- Enhanced day/night toggle with centered hover animations

### Settings Components
- Redesigned SliderControl with inline layout: label, revert button, slider, value display
- Updated ToggleControl to include revert buttons with enhanced override styling
- Modified ImageGrid to show revert button next to section title when applicable
- Added revert.svg icon and updated icon infrastructure to support new functionality

### Color System
- Implemented currentScreenColor derived store for dynamic theming
- Applied screen-specific colors consistently across sliders, toggles, and override modes
- Added smooth cubic-bezier transitions matching the screen switcher animations
- Updated color palette to use muted gray instead of white for first color

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed revert button logic in non-override mode by using actual default values instead of screen settings
- Corrected toggle color styling by targeting proper CSS classes (.switch-button, .switch-checked)
- Resolved muted toggle colors - now display bright screen colors as intended
- Fixed CSS selector specificity issues that prevented proper color application

### Technical Improvements
- Added proper hover effects maintaining screen color with opacity changes
- Cleaned up duplicate CSS rules and improved selector specificity
- Enhanced override mode visualization with glow effects and better contrast
- Adjusted main window dimensions and spacing for better visual balance

## Testing
- Verified all components build and run successfully
- Confirmed TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Tested revert functionality in both override and non-override modes
- Validated color transitions work smoothly across screen switches

## Files Modified
- `pkg/shared/src/components/settings/` - All major settings components
- `pkg/shared/src/assets/icons/` - Added revert icon and updated infrastructure
- `pkg/shared/src/stores/settingsStore.ts` - Added color derivation logic
- `pkg/shared/src/types/settings.ts` - Updated color palette
- `pkg/app/src/main/windows/mainWindow.ts` - Adjusted window dimensions

The settings interface now provides consistent visual feedback and proper functionality across all components, with smooth color transitions that match the overall design system.
