# Port Change Implementation

Date: 2025-08-14

## Overview

Implementing user-controlled port changes with confirmation flow and connection status feedback. The system uses a store/observer pattern where LocalServer reacts to port changes and BackgroundManager reacts to server restart signals.

## Architecture

1. **LocalServer** observes user options for port changes and restarts itself
2. **BackgroundManager** observes server restart signals and reloads windows
3. **OptionsScreen** provides confirmation UI and connection status feedback

## Key Components

- Server port management with restart capability
- Background window coordination via appStore signals  
- Enhanced UI with confirmation flow and status indicators
- API extensions for port restart and status checking

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Backend server restart logic
- [ ] Background window coordination  
- [ ] API extensions for port management
