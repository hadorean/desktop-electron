# API Error Documentation

## Image API Endpoints Error Handling

This document outlines potential errors and edge cases for the image-related API endpoints.

### Common Error Responses

#### 400 Bad Request

- Missing `name` parameter in query string
- Invalid or empty image name

#### 403 Forbidden

- Path traversal attempts (e.g., `../../../sensitive-file`)
- Attempts to access files outside the configured images directory

#### 404 Not Found

- Image file does not exist
- Image file was deleted after being listed

#### 500 Internal Server Error

- File system permission issues
- Disk I/O errors
- Server configuration problems

### Endpoint-Specific Errors

#### GET /api/images

**Potential Issues:**

- Images directory doesn't exist or is inaccessible
- Permission denied reading directory contents
- Network drive disconnection (if images stored remotely)
- Large directory causing memory issues

**Error Response Example:**

```json
{
	"error": "Internal Server Error",
	"message": "Failed to retrieve images list"
}
```

#### GET /api/image?name={name}

**Potential Issues:**

- File not found (file deleted between listing and request)
- File permissions changed
- Corrupted image file
- Network issues if images on remote storage
- File locked by another process

**Error Response Examples:**

```json
{
	"error": "Not Found",
	"message": "Image not found"
}
```

```json
{
	"error": "Forbidden",
	"message": "Access denied to path outside images directory"
}
```

#### GET /api/thumbnail?name={name}

**Potential Issues:**

- Same as image endpoint (currently serving original images)
- Future: Thumbnail generation failures
- Future: Thumbnail cache corruption
- Future: Out of disk space for thumbnail storage

### Security Considerations

1. **Path Traversal Protection**: Server validates that requested paths stay within the images directory
2. **File Extension Validation**: Only whitelisted image extensions are served
3. **URL Encoding**: Proper decoding of URL-encoded paths to handle special characters
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for large image requests

### Performance Considerations

1. **Large Files**: Very large image files may cause timeouts
2. **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple simultaneous large image requests could overwhelm server
3. **Disk Space**: Monitor available disk space for thumbnail generation
4. **Memory Usage**: Large images may consume significant memory during serving

### Future Thumbnail Service Errors

When the thumbnail service is implemented, additional error scenarios:

1. **Image Processing Failures**: Corrupted source images, unsupported formats
2. **Queue Overflow**: Too many thumbnail generation requests
3. **Generation Timeouts**: Complex images taking too long to process
4. **Storage Issues**: Insufficient space for thumbnail cache
5. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple requests for same thumbnail during generation

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. Log all 500 errors with full error details
2. Monitor response times for image serving
3. Track 404 rates (may indicate broken client caches)
4. Monitor disk space usage
5. Alert on repeated 403 errors (potential security issues)

### Client Best Practices

1. Handle 404 errors gracefully (show placeholder images)
2. Implement client-side caching with proper cache invalidation
3. Use progressive loading for large images
4. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for 5xx errors
5. Validate URLs before making requests to avoid 400 errors
